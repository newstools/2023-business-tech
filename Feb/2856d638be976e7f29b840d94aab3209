Over the past 24 hours, a generating unit each at Camden, Duvha and Lethabo power stations suffered breakdowns and were taken offline for repairs. The return to service of two generating units at Drakensberg and a unit each at Kendal and Tutuka power stations are delayed. Two generating units at Lethabo Power Station were returned to service during the period. Breakdowns currently amount to 19,385MW of generating capacity, while 3,566W of generating capacity is out of service for planned maintenance.
