According to the group, its bursaries provide financial assistance towards tuition and on-campus accommodation and are also linked to work-back agreements – ensuring job opportunities upon graduation. “Shoprite offers a range of exciting jobs at various offices around Africa, a wide range of vacancies in-store, as well as opportunities through programmes such as the apprenticeships at its Data Science Academy. As a leading employer in South Africa, the Shoprite Group welcomes hard-working and passionate individuals to join us in becoming the best retailer in the world,” it said. “All bursary recipients are offered employment with the group on completion of their studies.” In the last financial year, the retailer spent over R16 million on its bursary programme, which funded 206 students. The group is placing a particular focus on Data Science in 2023, having successfully started its own Data Science Academy, producing top-level specialists in the field of data science. “Successful applicants will join the pipeline for the academy. With a plan to keep this academy growing in the years to come, Shoprite is now looking for university students who have a passion for data and would like to make the data academy their starting point in an exciting career,” it said.
