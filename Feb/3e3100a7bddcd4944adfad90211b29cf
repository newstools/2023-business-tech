The Toyota C-HR and Lexus RX are tied as the most reliable car in the JD Power US Vehicle Dependability Study (VDS) for 2023. JD Power’s VDS – now in its 34th year – looks at how 2020 model-year vehicles are performing in terms of component replacement, appeal and quality – this includes vehicles with new technology. The VDS intends to help manufacturers build vehicles that can withstand the test of time and promote high resale value. The Toyota C-HR and Lexus RX reported 111 problems per 100 (PP100) vehicles sold – the industry average is 186 PP100. Both models showed improvement in eight of the nine problem categories identified by JD Power the year prior. The cars take the crown from last year’s champion – the Porsche 911. Regarding brands, Lexus ranks highest overall for vehicle dependability, scoring 133 PP100. Other premium brands that ranked highly included Genesis (144 PP100), Cadillac (173 PP100) and BMW (184 PP100). The Toyota Motor Company is also the parent company that received the most model-level awards with six, including the Lexus NX, Lexus RX, Toyota C-HR, Toyota Highlander, Toyota Sienna and Toyota Tacoma. Kia (152 PP100) ranked first for reliability in the mass market segment for a third consecutive year but lost its 2022 crown as the most reliable car brand overall. Buick (159 PP100), Chevrolet (162 PP100), Mitsubishi (167 PP100) and Toyota (168 PP100) were close behind in the 2023 mass market segment. On the other end of the rankings, Land Rover (273 PP100), Lincoln (259 PP100), and Audi (252 PP100) were named the most unreliable brands in JD Power’s rankings. The brands that saw the most improvement in the number of problems were Ram (77 PP100 improvement), Volvo (41 PP100 improvement) and Nissan (35 PP100 improvement). Interestingly, premium brands report far more problems (205 PP100) than mass-market brands (182 PP100). A key reason for this is that premium brands often implement more technology, leading to increased complexity and creating additional problems. “It is typical in the automotive industry to roll out concepts and features by putting them in premium vehicles first,” Frank Hanley, senior director of auto benchmarking at JD Power, said. Infotainment systems remain the most problematic parts of a car, with an average of 49.9 PP100 – twice as much as the next-highest category. Problem areas include built-in voice recognition, Android Apple CarPlay connectivity, Bluetooth systems, difficult touchscreens, too few power plugs, and outdated maps. JD Power’s findings showed that owners’ relationships with their vehicles include how up-to-date the technology is. For example, vehicle satisfaction scores improved when vehicles receive over-the-air software updates for infotainment systems that are seen as out of date. Despite the rankings taking into account new technologies, Elon Musk’s Telsa (242 PP100) is not part of the brand rankings as the electric car company did not divulge owner information in states where that permission is required by law. Overall, JD Power said that there was a reduction in component replacements, with 63% of vehicles requiring fewer component replacements over the past year (not including wear and tear) compared to the 2022 VDS. There were fewer replacements required for brake rotors, headlight components, exterior lights, and key fobs. JD Power’s analysis shows that residual values for vehicles are massively affected by long-term quality. “The used-vehicle market has helped sustain dealers’ profitability in the past couple of years, but they need to know which vehicles to have on their lots,” said Jonathan Banks, vice president and general manager of vehicle valuations at JD Power, said. Cars with strong dependability scores often bring greater foot traffic into dealerships.
