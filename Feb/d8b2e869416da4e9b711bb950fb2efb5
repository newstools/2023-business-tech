Multichoice has announced subscription fee hikes for its DStv packages in South Africa, which will kick in from 1 April 2023. Prices will increase by an average of 4.3% across DStv’s satellite pay-TV portfolio. DStv’s streaming-only packages will remain unchanged. “[The price adjustment] is far lower than the projected CPI for 2023,” MultiChoice said in a statement. Premium subscribers will pay R40 more per month, an increase of 4.8%. The Access Fee for features like DStv Catch Up and PVR will also increase by R5 per month — a 4.5% increase. Compact Plus will increase by R30 per month (5.5%), Compact by R20 per month (4.7%), Family by R10 per month (3.2%), and Access by R9 (7.5%). DStv EasyView and BoxOffice prices will not change this year. MultiChoice said the price for its ADD Movies add-on decreased by 20% (R20 per month) during the year and will not be adjusted on 1 April. “The pressure that consumers are facing due to remnants of the pandemic, as well as the continued rolling blackouts nationwide, has not been lost on us,” MultiChoice said. “These nominal adjustments help DStv to ensure that South Africans continue to enjoy the best value and unrivalled access to entertainment, anywhere, anytime, and at the most affordable price.” The price hikes are detailed below: This article was first published on MyBroadband, you can view the original with additional details here.
