Sponsored articles are a great way to build trust in your brand and create awareness about your products. In fact, the Broad Media 2022 Digital Marketing Report found that sponsored articles are the most trusted form of online advertising in South Africa. If you want to take advantage of this excellent marketing opportunity, you should work with BusinessTech – South Africa’s largest and most influential business news website. BusinessTech boasts a big audience of South African C-level executives, business owners, company directors, managers, and professionals. These influential businesspeople read BusinessTech on a daily basis and have significant impacts on their organisations’ purchasing decisions. They also are key decision makers within their households – so they are a great audience for both B2C and B2B products and solutions.

Once you have booked a package, you will be allocated an account manager, who will help you through the entire process – from getting an article written (if required), to getting it published to a targeted audience.
