Local order books for the fully electric Volvo C40 Recharge have opened in South Africa at a starting price of R1,285,000. South Africa’s initial allocation of the vehicle is 50 units, with the first customer cars scheduled to be delivered in June 2023, said Volvo. Orders can be made through the My Volvo website. The C40 Recharge is the Swedish luxury car company’s first step towards its goal of half of its global sales volume comprising fully electric cars by 2025, with the remainder taking the form of hybrids. By 2030, Vovlo plans for every new vehicle it sells to be completely electric. The C40 Recharge has a twin-motor configuration, one on the front axle and another on the rear. This aids the car in having all-wheel drive traction and high output levels. Volvo said that the car could put out 300kW of power and 660Nm of torque at its peak. “With immediate access to its maximum torque figure, the 0-100km/h sprint is dispatched in 4.7 seconds.” The purchase price includes the Volvo Care package, which comprises a five-year maintenance plan and warranty (with the battery pack covered for eight years or 160 000 km), a home charging wall box and a public charging cable, said Volvo. Greg Maruszewski, the managing director at Volvo Car South Africa, said: “The sleekly styled C40 Recharge’s low roofline and striking rear-end design contribute to its aerodynamic shape, yet it still offers the high seating position most Volvo drivers prefer. “It also features a generous luggage capacity of 489 litres, accessed via the standard power-operated tailgate and supplemented by a handy 31-litre frunk,” he said.
