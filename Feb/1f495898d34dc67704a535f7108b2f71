Property management company PayProp’s latest annual market report for 2022 details how much average South Africans are paying on rent across the country’s nine provinces. “Annual rental growth statistics reveal a clear upward movement in Q4. The average rent increased by 3.4% year-on-year, representing an increase of R269 from R7,906 per month in Q4 2021 to R8,175 in Q4 2022,” said PayProp. The property company said that high commodity inflation and increasing interest rates are pressuring both landlords and tenants in 2023. PayProp SA Deputy CEO Michelle Dickens noted that landlords are affected by the mismatch between rent escalation and inflation while rising interest rates worsen tenants’ debt-to-income ratio. “While landlords are receiving below-inflation rent increases, each interest rate hike has put tenant affordability under increasing pressure as their debt obligations to credit providers increase,” said Dikens. “In the most recent PayProp State of the Rental Industry Survey, 85% of agents reported “moving to a more affordable property” as one of tenants’ top three reasons for moving – up from 58% last year,” said Dickens. This reinforces the overarching trend of affordability as the real driver behind the real estate market in 2023,” she added. The national picture The report’s national sentiment places inflation as the most significant risk to the rental market. Nationally, net monthly income increased from R1 476 to R36 288 – representing a year-on-year (YoY) increase of 4.2%, said PayProp. “While tenants will welcome any increase in income, it has not kept up with inflation which puts more pressure on tenants’ already squeezed finances,” the company said. According to the report, tenants across the country spent an average of 29.1% of their income on rent. When you include debt repayments of 46.6%, this leaves tenants with only 24.3% of their income to spend on food, school fees, entertainment and the like, said PayProp. As a result, 28.5% of tenants were labelled as presenting a high credit risk during Q4 2022 – increasing by 4% compared to the corresponding period. 18% of tenants had a major delinquency against their name, compared to 16.8% in the same quarter the year before, while the average credit score worsened slightly from 646 in Q4 2021 to 641 in Q4 2022. “These are clear signs that tenants are struggling to keep up with the rising cost of living and the increasing cost of servicing debt,” said PayProp. The area-specific trends affecting each province across the country are listed below, as outlined by PayProp.
