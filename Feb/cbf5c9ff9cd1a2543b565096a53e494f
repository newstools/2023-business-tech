Business Talk with Michael Avery, South Africa’s leading online business talk show, is the best place to promote your company as an industry leader. You can do this through excellent marketing solutions that get your brand and executives featured on the popular show. There are two options to choose from – Executive Interview Packages and Season Sponsorships. Executive Interview Packages get your executive featured on their own episode, which is great for thought leadership or to promote your latest products and services. Prominent guests who have had their own episode on Business Talk include: Andrew Golding – Chief Executive of the Pam Golding Property Group
Sim Tshabalala – Joint Chief Executive of the Standard Bank Group
Michael Jordaan – Co-Founder of Bank Zero
Lillian Barnard – CEO of Microsoft South Africa
Magda Wierzycka – Co-Founder of Sygnia
Jacques Celliers – CEO of First National Bank Season Sponsorships let your company sponsor an entire season of Business Talk – which is an incredible branding opportunity. Past Business Talk sponsors include Discovery Bank, EY, Discovery Business Insurance, EY-Parthenon, Sage, Microsoft, and Monocle. Business Talk is part of the BusinessTech stable, which lets us give your interviews a broader reach. Your interviews will be published on the Business Talk website, BusinessTech, YouTube, Facebook, and Spotify. If you are a Season Sponsor, you will have your branding on all of these platforms each time an episode from your sponsored series goes live.
