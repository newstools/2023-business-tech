Mariska Comins is the Head of Technical Advisory Services at PSG and has been with the company since 2012. She acquired a detailed understanding of both wealth management and insurance products during her previous role as the PSG Regional Manager for the Western Cape. She holds a B.Compt Honours Degree, and in 2018 she was admitted as a Chartered Accountant. In today’s episode of Business Talk, Mariska Comins talks about saving for retirement. She starts by comparing retirement annuities (RAs) to provident and pension funds, and explains why South Africans should consider having both. Comins then touches on the consequences of contributing more than your annual limit to an RA and how the consequences differ if you do the same thing with a tax-free savings account (TFSA). She then explains what happens to your RAs and TFSAs if you emigrate from South Africa, before commenting on whether she thinks now is a good time to invest in your retirement.
