From traditional lagers to craft brews, beer has become a staple of South African culture, and its popularity shows no sign of slowing down. According to Statista, 2.2 billion litres of beer was consumed in South Africa in 2022, which is expected to increase to 3.4 billion by the end of 2026. By 2027, 11% of spending and 12% of volume consumption in the Beer segment will be attributable to out-of-home consumption (e.g., in bars and restaurants). One factor contributing to beer’s popularity in South Africa is the country’s thriving craft beer scene. With an increasing number of microbreweries popping up throughout the country, beer lovers have access to a wide variety of unique and interesting brews made with local ingredients – showcasing the distinct flavours of the region. Another reason for the growing popularity of beer in South Africa is its affordability. While imported beer can be expensive, locally brewed beer is often more accessible and affordable. In fact, many South African breweries have started producing beer in cans and bottles designed to be more affordable and accessible to a broader range of consumers. The country’s love for beer is also evident in the many festivals and events throughout the year. These events offer a chance for beer enthusiasts to come together and sample a wide variety of brews, from traditional lagers to experimental IPAs and stouts. Beer is deeply ingrained in South African culture, with many locals enjoying a cold beer after a long day at work, watching sports, or socialising with friends and family. Beer is often seen as a social lubricant that helps bring people together and create a sense of community. Whether you prefer a traditional lager or an experimental craft brew, there’s something for everyone in South Africa’s thriving beer culture.
