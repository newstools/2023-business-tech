The City of Tshwane has alerted residents that Rand Water will be shutting down a key pipeline for maintenance later in February, which will lead to zero water supply to certain areas for around 30 hours. The shutdown is planned to complete tie-ins of the newly installed S4 water supply, which saw outages in regions across Gauteng in 2022. The work will take place from 03h00 on Friday, 24 February 2023, and continue until 09h00 on Saturday, 25 February 2023. “During the shutdown, there will be no water supply from Rand Water’s Vlakfontein Reservoir to Tshwane,” the city said. “We appeal to all residents to use water sparingly during this time. The City of Tshwane will fill the reservoirs before the shutdown. Rand Water has further informed the City that their supply recovery time will be approximately two weeks in the event that they run empty.” The city said that roaming water tankers will be arranged for all affected areas.
