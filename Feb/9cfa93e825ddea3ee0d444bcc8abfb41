Power utility Eskom has published the latest load shedding schedule for the week ahead. Rolling blackouts will move to a rotation of stage 3 and stage 4 load shedding this week, with the aim of reducing to stage 2 and stage 3 by the middle of the week. Stage 3 load shedding will be implemented at 05h00 – 16h00 daily, while stage 4 load shedding will be implemented nightly at 16h00 – 05h00 on both Monday and Tuesday. On Wednesday, stage 2 load shedding will be implemented at 05h00 – 16h00, followed by stage 3 load shedding at 16h00 – 05h00. A further update will be published as soon as any significant changes occur, Eskom said. The schedule is as follows: Sunday, 5 February Stage 2: until 00h00 Monday, 6 February Stage 2: 00h00 to 05h00
Stage 3: 05h00 to 16h00
Stage 4: 16h00 to 00h00 Tuesday, 7 February Stage 4: 00h00 to 05h00
Stage 3: 05h00 to 16h00
Stage 4: 16h00 to 00h00 Wednesday, 8 February Stage 4: 00h00 to 05h00
Stage 2: 05h00 to 16h00
Stage 3: 16h00 to 00h00 Thursday, 9 February Stage 3: 00h00 to 05h00
TBA: 05h00 onwards  Since Saturday, two generation units at Arnot, a single unit each at Camden, Duvha and Kendal power stations were taken offline for repairs. The return to service of a generation unit each at
Kendal and Lethabo power stations have been delayed while a unit each at Duvha and Lethabo power stations were returned to service. Breakdowns currently amount to 15,215MW of generating capacity, while 5,199MW of generating capacity is out of service for planned maintenance. During a briefing last week, Eskom said that, over the medium term, more generating units should be brought back from planned maintenance ahead of the winter months, which should help the utility better meet demand over the period. The group is putting great focus on returning units from planned maintenance so this can be done reliably and on time. Unfortunately, when it comes to unplanned outages, units are proving to be unreliable and thus introduce high levels of unpredictability to the system. The power utility is embarking on a five-point plan to tackle the worst of load shedding in the immediate term, focusing on painting higher levels of energy availability at the best-performing units while trying to turn around operations at six underperforming stations in the fleet. According to the Eskom board, it is also trying to restore morale amongst workers and proceeding with the legal separation of the group into three different companies.
