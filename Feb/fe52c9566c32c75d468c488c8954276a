The next generation Mahindra Scorpio-N SUV will go on sale in South Africa on 20 February 2023, with pre-orders available online from Wednesday (8 February). “Built from the ground up with no carryover components from the legacy Scorpio, the Scorpio-N elevates existing segment benchmarks across all critical parameters: performance, capabilities, technology, sophistication, ride and handling, NVH, interiors, appearance and most crucially, safety,” said Mahindra SA. The All-New Scorpio-N became the first body-on-frame SUV to secure a 5-star rating in the Global New Car Assessment Programme’s (GNCAP) new crash-test protocols, which came into effect on 1 July 2022, it added. Additionally, the Scorpio-N has the lowest CO2 emission in its segment through adopting several environment-friendly manufacturing processes – including the latest generation dip paint, low RRC tyres, and LEDs for reducing the overall energy consumption by 10%. Features The New Mahindra Scorpio-N is available in three trim lines – the Z4, Z8, and Z8L. According to TopAuto, The entry-level Z4 trim comes with a semi-digital instrument cluster consisting of a 7-inch display flanked by analogue dials and the new 8-inch AdrenoX infotainment system with Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, and built-in navigation. Additional features include cruise control, rear cameras, reverse parking sensors, dual-zone climate control, hill ascent and descent assist, driver drowsiness detection, six airbags, and 17 steel wheels. The Z8 adds coffee-black leatherette upholstery, automatic LED head and taillights, keyless entry and start, rain-sensing wipers, a third climate control zone, and 18-inch alloys, said TopAuto. In contrast, the Z8L further gets a 12-speaker Sony stereo, a front camera, front parking sensors, a wireless charger, and an electric driver seat.  Performance The Scorpio-N variants will come with a 2.2-litre turbo-diesel motor pushing out 129kW and 400Nm at an average consumption of 7.2l/100km, connected to a six-speed automatic transmission. TopAuto noted that the SUV will feature three driving modes,  “Zip, Zap, and Zoom”, which loosely translates to Eco, Normal, and Sport. The 4×4 variants will add Grass, Gravel, Snow, Mud, Rut, and Sand settings – including mechanical locking rear differential and brake locking differential.
