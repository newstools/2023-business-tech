Load-shedding is wreaking havoc on South African businesses and with a global recession on the horizon, companies must find alternative solutions to keep their operations running. iStore Business offers a simple solution – the Apple MacBook Air with an 18-hour battery life. Click here to find out more about the MacBook Air from iStore Business. The MacBook Air’s all-day battery life will keep your employees productive and your business running smoothly, even during the more extreme stages of load-shedding. The average person working on a computer loses at least two hours of work per day to load-shedding. This is extremely destructive to businesses, as they are paying employees for this lost time, which could be focused on growth. Missed opportunities are also a huge problem. People in sales positions, for example, lose hundreds of hours and millions of rands per year due to downtime from load-shedding. The 13-inch M1 MacBook Air cuts out this lost time by giving your employees, and therefore your business, the power to work during extended power cuts thanks to its 18-hour battery life. Whether your employees are surfing the web or performing more intensive tasks, the 13-inch M1 MacBook Air’s record-breaking battery life will enable them to remain productive at all times. This is largely thanks to Apple’s M1 chips that take power and efficiency to a new level to deliver exceptional performance – whether your MacBook is plugged in or not. This efficiency extends beyond the processors’ internal workings to your employees, too, with the M-series chips offering a significant performance boost of up to 50% over other computers. Your employees are, therefore, more productive across every task. Furthermore, the lightweight, portable design of the MacBook Air ensures your employees can work either from home or the office, regardless of their power situation.  iStore Business offers easy and affordable ways for your business to reap the financial and productivity benefits of the M1 MacBook Air. A great example of this affordability is the option to rent the 13-inch 8-core M1 MacBook Air with 256GB storage and a 7-core GPU for just R299 per month over 36 months, when you trade in a previous-generation MacBook Air. This is an excellent option for cash-strapped businesses that want to stay productive during load-shedding. If you decide not to rent, but still trade-in, the 13-inch M1 MacBook Air is only R9,499. Alternatively, iStore Business is currently offering companies R3,000 off the purchase price of the 13-inch MacBook Air – meaning you only pay R16,999 if you are not trading in another device.
