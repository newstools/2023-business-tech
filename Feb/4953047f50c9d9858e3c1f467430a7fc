Communication service WhatsApp has several new features in the pipeline, with a handful of betas currently under testing. According to the data service WABetaInfo, some of the latest include reporting statuses, changing the search bar functionality, editing messages and scheduling group calls. As one of the most popular messaging apps in South Africa, Whatsapp is known for its constant updates and beta testing. These updates often bring new features and improvements. The beta testing program allows users to try out new features before they are officially released, helping to make the overall experience more efficient for users. Here are four recently listed updates on the horizon for WhatsApp: Schedule group call Like Zoom or Google Meet, WhatsApp is now trailing a feature allowing users to schedule a group call. After testing is completed and the feature is added to the app, there will be a new menu that will allow various schedule options allowing users to choose the name, who will join and when it will take place. WABetaInfo said that this new ability is still under development and will be released in a future update of the app. Edit messages WhatsApp is currently developing a new feature that would allow users to edit messages after they have sent them. “Thanks to this feature, users will have up to 15 minutes to edit their messages in order to fix any mistake or include additional information to the original message,” said WABetaInfo. Search bar update For those who struggle to navigate through the app’s settings, iOS users can soon expect to have a search bar. “This feature is designed to help users easily navigate through the app settings by allowing them to search for specific settings instead of having to scroll through the list,” said WABetaInfo. Report status update WABetaInfo reported that WhatsApp for iOS is currently testing and rolling out a new beta that will give users the ability to report status. The new feature would encourage statuses to remain in line with the app’s terms of service by alerting the company’s moderation team to determine if it should remain on the app. “The report feature for status updates plays a crucial role in maintaining the platform safe and secure for all users, and it is worth noting that this feature is not uncommon, as other instant messaging apps offer similar reporting features,” WABetaInfo said.
