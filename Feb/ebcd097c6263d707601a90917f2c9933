Balwin Properties is ready to launch its R10 billion Munyaka development in Waterfall City, which promises to bring “beachside living” to Johannesburg. The gated development is expected to be completed in 2028, and will feature a man-made beach and the 3-hectare Crystal Lagoon. This lagoon is Balwin’s second clearwater lagoon after the Blyde in Tshwane East became the first development in South Africa to incorporate a clearwater lagoon built in a beach setting. Balwin has an exclusivity agreement with Crystal Lagoons to develop these freshwater lagoons in strategic nodes in the future. Munyaka will comprise 5,178 one-, two- and three-bedroom apartments, some of which are lagoon and beach facing. In addition to Balwin’s Classic offering, Lifestyle apartments and two ultra-luxurious penthouse apartments have been constructed above the lifestyle centre, offering spectacular views of the lagoon and the city skyline. All apartments are fibre-ready, and include a Scandinavian-style kitchen, eco-friendly appliances, a balcony for outdoor entertainment and pre-paid water and electricity meters. Prices for classic apartments in the development start at R989,900. Lagoon-facing apartments start at R3 million.
