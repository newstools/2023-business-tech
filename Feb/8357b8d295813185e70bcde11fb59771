In 2023, there will be more than a dozen electric vehicles (EVs) that forward-looking individuals can choose from, with several new models having launched last year. The brands that entered the South African market with new models recently included Audi, BMW, and Mercedes-Benz. “In the first three months of 2022, South Africa sold over 1,400 electric vehicles. This is more than 2020 and 2021 combined,” said the chief executive of  MasterDrive, Eugene Herbert. However, despite the positive sales. Herbert said there are notable challenges facing EV adoption in South Africa – including a lack of infrastructure, range anxiety, and affordability. An unreliable energy supply poses a unique challenge in South Africa, which is far behind in development. The country also lacks charging points along long-distance routes, said Herbert. This low number of sharing stations means that South African motorists are particularly concerned that their EV will not make the range of long driving trips, added Herbert. With EV adoption and infrastructure in its infancy in South Africa, the current EVs on offer are also priced as luxury cars – with pricing that is out of reach for most of South Africa. As of February 2023, only one wall-fed car on the market is priced at less than R1 million, namely the Mini Cooper SE, with its asking price of R742,000. On the other end of the scale, the most expensive EV model is the Audi RS e-tron GT – which costs over a whopping R3 million. Despite these challenges, Herbert said that there are just as many solutions – adding that the change to EVs is not a matter of ‘if’ but a ‘when.’ Herbert explained that affordability would increase once more models are made available, while price parity with petrol-engine vehicles is expected by 2025. The government’s Green Paper is also gaining traction and may re-look at the 25% import tax currently imposed on EVs. Regarding infrastructure, he noted that Jaguar is installing 82 charging ports in major hubs and popular holiday routes in South Africa, while ZimiCharge, a third-party app, looks to branch into ports – with 10,000 planned. Herbert said that range anxiety had also been a priority for manufacturers, with their latest models already showing great improvements, such as the Mercedes-Benz EQS and the BMW i7, which offer a 782 km and 625 km range, respectively.
