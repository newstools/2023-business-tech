South Africa’s ministers and deputy ministers of various departments within government are afforded luxury cars – with price tags ranging from R640,000 to over R1 million. Responding in several written parliamentary Q&As over the past week, government departments – including the departments of Health, Human Settlements, Basic Education and Sports, Arts and Culture – revealed which cars their ministers and deputy ministers currently drive. The responses came to questions posed by the Democratic Alliance (DA), which asked various governmental departments for details regarding the make, model, year of manufacture, cost and purchase date of all the official vehicles purchased for the respective ministers and deputy ministers since 1 June 2019. While the minister of police, Bheki Cele, responded that the requested information was classified for safety reasons, the other departments provided the requested information. Ministers and deputy ministers are enjoying rides from some of the top German luxury brands, favouring Audi, BMW and Mercedes-Benz. The amount that ministers spend on cars is informed by the ministerial handbook – a  guide to the ‘benefits and privileges’ that members of the cabinet are entitled to. Per the spending limit for the relevant years (2019-2022), ministers were afforded R700,000 for an official vehicle. This was bumbed up to R800,000 in 2020. According to the 2019 version of the handbook – which is currently in effect after the 2022 version was reverted by president Cyril Ramaphosa last year – National Members of the executive are provided with one vehicle for official use in each seat of office. Many of the vehicles’ purchase prices are lower than ordinary South Africans would pay. This is because departments must purchase a vehicle through the transversal contract
concluded by the National Treasury for the procurement of bulk motor vehicles for members directly from manufacturers. The vehicles are also older models, as departments are only allowed to replace vehicles if they have reached 120,000 km or five years (whichever comes first) or the vehicle experiences serious mechanical problems and is in poor condition. According to the handbook, on assuming the office, ministers must make use of the official vehicles already purchased by the department unless the vehicles qualify to be replaced. An overview of the vehicles ministers and their deputy ministers drive – including the price paid for the car – is listed below.
