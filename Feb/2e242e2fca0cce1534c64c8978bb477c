Apart from standing a chance of winning big, there’s OUTvest’s low-fee advantage. While some traditional investment providers can charge up to 3% (sometimes more) of your investment amount in fees each year, OUTvest’s transparent ONEfee can be as low as 0.45% a year. In short, there’s more money left in your investment to grow. To see how much you’re paying currently, ask your investment provider for your Effective Annual Cost (EAC) and do the comparison for yourself. And while you’re at it, check out how OUTvest’s fund performance compares to their peers. All the info you need is published regularly on their Money Advice blog at outvest.co.za – as part of their Monthly Market Commentary. It may sound like a lot of admin, but it isn’t with OUTvest.
