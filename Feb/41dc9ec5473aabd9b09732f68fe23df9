According to the Ford Motor Company 11th annual Trends report, an ‘every cloud has a silver lining’ sentiment remains among surveyors, despite national and global economic headwinds. 16,200 online interviews across six countries were part of Ford’s Trend report. The survey explores various themes, including facing fears, escapism, and taking a stand on certain issues. The survey analysed consumer preferences and behaviours in response to environmental changes. One insight suggests that “the participants of the survey believe society will be stronger in five years. Consumers have not given up on the notion of a ‘happily ever after’  but for now, they will gladly settle for some silver linings wherever they can find them,” says Jen Brace, Ford’s Global Trends and Futuring Team. 82% of South Africans believe that more is being done to cause division in South Africa instead of uniting it The report said that political protests have led to consumer boycotts, especially towards brands that are neutral on social and environmental problems. 89% of South African respondents said that companies should take greater accountability for environmental and humanitarian issues.
