A new entry-level trim of the Volkswagen T-Cross mini SUV called the Trendline is coming to South Africa. The German-founded VW car brand is widely popular among South African motorists, with the most notable car being the VW Polo. The T-cross is a big brother to the Polo, satisfying demand for larger SUV/crossover-type body shapes. Volkswagen South Africa has announced that in the second quarter of 2023, the Trendline will stand alongside the current configurations, namely the Comfortline, Highline and R-Line. The Trendline trim has traditionally been the most entry-level version in Volkswagen’s line-up. According to TopAuto, the Trendline model is expected to be priced lower than the current starting price of nearly R400,000, making it more accessible to buyers. Although it is unlikely that the 2023 Trendline model will be as affordable as the 2020 version, it is expected to be more competitively priced. VW will likey price the Trendline inline with rivals such as the Chery Tiggo 4 Pro, Ford EcoSport, Haval Jolion, Kia Sonet, and Toyota Corolla Cross, all of which are priced between R300,000 and R381,000, reported TopAuto. The upcoming T-Cross Trendline is anticipated to share the same powertrain as the entry-level Comfortline variant, which comprises a 1.0-litre turbocharged gasoline engine and a five-speed manual transmission. This setup can generate 70kW of power and 175Nm of torque. Fuel consumption-wise, the current Comfortline offers 4.8 litres per 100km. The new VW is expected to be followed by updated versions and other configurations of the brand in 2023, including the Tiguan TDI, around the same time as the T-Cross Trendline. In the final quarter of this year, both the VW Polo Sedan TSI and the VW Touareg Facelift are expected to arrive on South African soil. As it stands, the current modules are priced as follows: Comfortline – R393,400
Highline – R478,000
R-Line – R518,800     Read: This car type offers the best value for money in South Africa
