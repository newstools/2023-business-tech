Several South African private schools whose pupils wrote the Independent Examinations Board (IEB) matric exams recorded exceptional results in 2022. The allure of sending your child to a private school in South Africa is rooted in the perception that these institutions provide a superior education. Private schools often offer smaller class sizes, more individual attention, and access to highly qualified teachers due to having more funding than their public counterparts. These differences seemed to reflect in their matric results, with the IEB confirming a 98.42% pass rate in 2022, a slight uptick from 98.39% recorded in 2021. In contrast, The Department of Basic Education has released the final National Senior Certificate results for the 2022 matric year showing a 3.7 percentage point increase in the pass rate to 80.1%. The top three independent boys’ school achievers included St. John’s College, Hilton, and St Benedict’s College. St John’s College recorded a 100% bachelor’s pass with 3.1 distinctions per candidate. Hilton and St Benedict’s College achieved a 99% bachelor’s pass with 2.43 and 2.41 distinctions per candidate, respectively. Comparatively, the top three girls’ school achievers were Roedean, St Mary’s Waverly, and St Andrew’s Senderwood. All three achieved a 100% bachelor’s pass with 4.64, 3.58, and 3.26 distinctions per candidate, respectively.
