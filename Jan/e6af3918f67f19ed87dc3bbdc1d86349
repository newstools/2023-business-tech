Crossover SUVs are notably popular among South African motorists, as they offer more roominess and higher clearance than standard cars – giving owners the best of both city and off-road driving across the demanding terrain the country’s roads have to offer. Crossovers offer a great combination of practicality and performance. They typically have more space and cargo room than a typical hatchback, making them perfect for families while maintaining a decent fuel consumption when compared to standard SUVs. Additionally, crossover SUVs are easier to manoeuvre around parking bays and in rush-hour traffic and are becoming more affordable, making them more accessible to a wider range of consumers. These advantages may be why eight crossover SUV’s featured on the National Association of Automobile Manufacturers of South Africa’s (Naamsa) top 20 best-selling cars in December 2022. According to their new vehicle sales report, Toyota was the favourite brand for local car buyers, with a total of 11,250 units sold, accounting for approximately 27% of the entire market across all vehicle categories. This meant that the Toyota Corolla Cross was the best-selling crossover in December, coming in 2nd place on the best-selling cars list – selling 1,834 units. The second best best-selling crossover was the Toyota Urban Cruiser, ranking 9th on Naamsa’s list with a sale of 945 units while the Chery Tiggo 4 Pro came in third, ranking 10th, selling a total of 857 units in December. Following the top three crossovers was the Nissan Magite in fourth place, the Haval Jolion in fifth, the VW T-Cross in sixth, Renault Kiger in seventh, and the Hyundai Venue in eighth position. These cars sold 771, 734, 689, 513, and 499 units over the December period. As it stands, there are 30 of the cheapest crossovers from every brand in South Africa – ranging from under R200,000 to just over R1 million. The cheapest listed crossover is the Mahindra KUV100 Nxt, selling at R172,999, while the Jaguar E-Pace D200 AWD R-Dynamic SE, the most expensive, retails at a cool R1,087,000.
