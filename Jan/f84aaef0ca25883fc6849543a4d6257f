Power utility Eskom will implement stage 3 load shedding on Wednesday until further notice. Load shedding will be pushed to stage 3 from 16h00, following the breakdown of two more units at its power stations, and the delay in returning to service of three generating units from planned maintenance Eskom said it would issue another update as soon as it becomes necessary. South Africa is likely to sit with prolonged levels of load shedding for the foreseeable future. In December 2022, 1,000MW was removed from the grid through Koeberg unit 1 being taken offline, and approximately 3,000MW is offline from various breakdowns at Kusile and Medupi. According to Eskom’s outlook for the next year, it needs to keep breakdowns below 13,000MW to stave off the worst of load shedding, but the utility has struggled to keep outages below 16,000MW – the worst-case scenario in its plans. Eskom CEO Andre de Ruyter also recently announced his resignation on the back of the worst levels of load shedding on record. While Public Enterprises minister Pravin Gordhan acknowledged that de Ruyter is not to blame for the load shedding, the power utility has not been able to resolve the crisis under his leadership. De Ruyter will be leaving the company at the end of March 2023. Eskom is still looking for his replacement.
