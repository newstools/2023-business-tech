While hybrid vehicles aren’t budget-friendly options, those who can afford one and are looking for a more future-proof vehicle will find comfort in the wide range of hybrid cars on offer in South Africa. While fully electric cars (EVs) are the top prize if you want to free yourself from climbing fuel prices, it exposes you to other potential annoyances unique to South Africa. South Africa’s EV charging infrastructure is still in its starting blocks, meaning you’ll still have to plan your schedule and long-distance travel routes carefully. Adding to this is the fact that extended load shedding can also potentially hinder your charging time at home. While hybrids aren’t cheap, EVs are even more expensive. South Africa’s most affordable “full-size” entry-level EV is the Mini Cooper SE – which will set you back R742,102. Hybrids, on the other hand, still provide you with the convenience of filling up at a fuel station combined with greater efficiency thanks to additional power supplied by an electric battery. Hybrid vehicles are also often more reliable than traditional cars. Because the electric motor provides additional power, the petrol engine does not have to work as hard, which can prolong its lifespan. Another benefit of hybrid vehicles is that they offer a smoother and quieter driving experience. The electric motor provides instant torque, which means the car does not make as much noise as a petrol engine – making it generally much quieter. However, hybrids aren’t much cheaper than EVs, as most of the cars on this list are priced over R1 million. There are 31 hybrids available in South Africa as of January 2023, and the cheapest car on the market is the Toyota Corolla Cross 1.8 Hybrid – with a starting price of R442,400. This title seemed to help the popularity of the Corolla Cross, as it was the second best-selling car in South Africa in December 2022, selling 1,834 units. In contrast, the most expensive hybrid on this list is the Ferrari 296, which sells for the same price as a luxury home with a price tag of R6.8 million. Due to the growing popularity of hybrids in South Africa, several manufacturers are updating their line-ups with new models in 2023. Nissan, Suzuki, and Toyota are set to bring new hybrids to the market that should sell for well below the price of the luxury brands, which include hybrid models for the Nissan Qashqai and the Suzuki Grand Vitara – among others.
