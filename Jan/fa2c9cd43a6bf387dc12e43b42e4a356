The ANC has cemented its push toward the green economy in South Africa. Speaking at the ruling party’s executive committee on its 8 January celebrations, ANC president Cyril Ramaphosa said that South Africa would develop the productive capacity to participate in the global green energy value chains, including green hydrogen and electric vehicles. “The ANC recognises important work in the Hydrogen Roadmap and directs the government to implement further supportive policy measures and actions to enable South Africa to become a green hydrogen centre,” said Ramaphosa. The process of creating hydrogen fuel through solar or wind-powered electrolysis, known as green hydrogen, has become a hot topic in South Africa in light of the fact that it could draw in a billion rand industry while decarbonising the economy. Green hydrogen projects form a part of the country’s shift away from coal-reliant energy supplies as one of the latest Just Transition Investment Plan’s four frontiers.
