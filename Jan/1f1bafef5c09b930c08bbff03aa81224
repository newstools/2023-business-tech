The Department of Basic Education has gazetted the salary adjustments for teachers in South Africa, back-dated to April 2022. The adjustments are based on the unilateral salary increase granted by the national government last year, equating to a 3% hike across the board for all public service workers in salary bands 1 to 12. Teacher salaries in South Africa are based on notches which vary on position and level of experience. The entry-level notch (notch 001) now offers an annual salary of R128,838 (R10,700 per month), but this climbs all the way up to notch 432, which offers an annual salary of R1,098,408 (R91,500 per month). Teachers who have a Relative Equivalent Qualification Value (REQV) 13, or a Matric plus three years of study, would earn a starting salary of R221,355 (R18,400 per month). By comparison, the minimum entry for an educator with REQV14 (Matric plus four years of study) is R292,764 (R24,400 per month). In 2022, the department noted that most new entrants to the system possess a four-year qualification or enter at a minimum of REQV14. The system has been designed so that teachers can earn progressively more as they advance through the system. Unsurprisingly, school managers hold the highest earning potential, with principals earning up to a maximum of over R1 million a year. In line with the government’s adjustments for the year, the payment of the current non-pensionable monthly cash allowance for teachers has also been extended to 31 March 2023, the department said. Research conducted by Stellenbosch University’s Research on Socio-Economic Policy (RESEP) shows that teachers earn more than the figures expressed in the basic salaries, however. According to the group, teachers’ total remuneration package includes large amounts of other benefits each month, such as receiving an employee pension contribution equal to 13% of the basic salary and an annual service bonus, i.e. a 13th cheque equal to the basic salary. All teachers who choose to join the Government Employees Medical Scheme (GEMS) also receive a medical aid subsidy – while some teachers who were appointed before 1 July 2006 may receive a smaller subsidy towards non-GEMS medical aid membership. Teachers who own or rent a property may also apply for a housing allowance, which is R1,500 per month. Overall, this can push the average salary from around R22,000 to R42,000 when taking these benefits into account. The all-inclusive salary notches gazetted by the department reflect this as well, with notch 001 totalling R810,498, all the way up to notch 121 at R1,467,768. Councillors, therapists and psychologists are also on their own salary scales and notches.
