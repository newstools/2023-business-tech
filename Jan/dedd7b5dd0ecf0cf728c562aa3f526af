Power utility Eskom says that load shedding will be ramped up to stage 3 and stage 4 this week. Addressing the media on Sunday, Eskom chief operating officer Jan Oberholzer said that the current schedule sees load shedding moving up to stage 3 on Sunday, before moving to stage 4 on Monday. The schedule for the week is as follows: Sunday, 22 January Stage 2: until 16h00
Stage 3: 16h00 to 00h00 Monday, 23 January Stage 3: 00h00 to 05h00
Stage 2: 05h00 to 16h00
Stage 4: 16h00 to 00h00 Tuesday, 24 January Stage 4: 00h00 to 05h00
Stage 1: 05h00 to 16h00
Stage 3: 16h00 to 00h00 Wednesday, 25 January Stage 3: 00h00 to 05h00
Stage 1: 05h00 to 16h00
Stage 3: 16h00 to 00h00 Thursday, 26 January Stage 3: 00h00 to 05h00
Stage 1: 05h00 to 16h00
Stage 3: 16h00 to 00h00 Friday, 27 January Stage 3: 00h00 to 05h00
Stage 1: 05h00 to 16h00
Stage 3: 16h00 to 00h00  Because the grid is unpredictable, things can change quickly, but Oberholzer said that with units expected to return during the week, load shedding could be reduced to stage 2 and stage 3 if things go well. The COO stressed that stage 8 load shedding is not expected. “While load shedding has been high for an extended period, there is no risk of any higher load shedding at this time,” Oberholzer said, adding that there is no risk of a blackout. Economists and analysts have warned that the load shedding situation in South Africa is likely to get a lot worse before it gets any better, with higher stages of load shedding likely to hit near the middle of the year. The key reasoning behind this view is that Eskom’s generating units are incredibly unreliable and break down on a regular basis, and the group cannot pull them down long enough to do maintenance and repairs. The situation is expected to get worse as the middle of the year is winter time in South Africa, when demand is higher. Addressing this maintenance crisis, Eskom chairperson Mpho Makwana said that a level of permanent stage 2 and stage 3 load shedding is expected to be in place for the next two years to give Eskom the room to conduct necessary maintenance. This will also deliver a relative degree of consistency and stability that South Africans and businesses can plan around. Makwana called on South Africans at large to assist in the crisis by lowering consumption.
