South Africans are benefitting significantly from lower prices for petrol and diesel this month – making it cheaper to fill up their daily drivers. From Wednesday, 4 January, motorists will see petrol prices drop by R2.06 per litre, now spending R21.40 for a litre of 95 unleaded petrol inland and R20.75 when at the coast. Diesel drivers will also see a drop at R2.81 taking the price per litre to R21.47. According to the Department of Mineral Resources and Energy, the decrease in fuel prices is due to the decrease in the cost of Brent Crude Oil. The decrease in fuel prices also comes amid concerns about a potential global recession, which may cause oil prices to continue declining. This decrease follows periods of increases putting more pressure on cash-strapped consumers. The drop can be attributed to a fall in the price of crude oil on the global market and the South African rand strengthening against the US dollar. The decrease in petrol prices is welcomed by South African consumers, as petrol is a significant expense for many households and businesses. It is, however, worth noting that petrol prices can be subject to fluctuations and may rise again in the future.
