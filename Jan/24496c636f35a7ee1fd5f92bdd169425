Planning your annual leave strategically in combination with the public holidays on offer can turn your standard 15 days of leave into 44 days off work in 2023. South Africans are said to be some of the hardest working employees worldwide, with some reports ranking South Africa at the fourth-highest position on the list of countries where employees work more than 50 hours a week, said First Group. In 2023, South Africans have two ‘extra’ public holidays, having 14 public holidays throughout the year, with two falling over a weekend. This is because the Public Holidays Act determines that whenever any public holiday falls on a Sunday, the Monday following it shall be a public holiday. While one of these holidays is already spent – 2 January 2023, making up for New Year’s Day which fell on a Sunday – but there will be one more ‘extra’ holiday in the year – Heritage Day on 25 September 2023. Here are all the public holidays in 2023 in terms of the Act: Sunday, 1 January: New Year’s Day
Monday, 2 January: Public holiday New Year’s Day observed 
Tuesday, 21 March: Human Rights Day
Friday, 7 April: Good Friday
Monday, 10 April: Family Day
Thursday, 27 April: Freedom Day
Monday, 1 May: Workers’ Day
Friday, 16 June: Youth Day
Wednesday, 9 August: National Women’s Day
Sunday, 24 September: Heritage Day
Monday, 25 September: Public holiday Heritage Day observed 
Saturday, 16 December: Day of Reconciliation
Monday, 25 December: Christmas Day
Tuesday, 26 December: Day of Goodwill The dates on which Good Friday and Easter Sunday fall are determined according to the ecclesiastical moon. That varies each year, but they fall at some point between late March and late April. Most employees are entitled to just 15 days of paid leave per year, and some companies stipulate that you must take the bulk of that leave over the annual shutdown period (usually mid to end of December). This means that 11 long months will likely be spent at the office. According to Shaun Lamont, managing director of First Group Hotels and Resorts, by taking leave on the right days in 2023, South Africans can turn 15 days of annual leave into 44 days off. “By cleverly applying for a day’s leave here and there, you can take full advantage of the days you are given to carve out the much-needed downtime you deserve and work hard for,” said Lamont. This is how it can be done: March For Human Rights Day on 21 March, take off the previous Friday (17 March) and the Monday (20 March) and get five days off. Human Rights Day: 21 March
Holiday Dates: 17 March – 21 March
