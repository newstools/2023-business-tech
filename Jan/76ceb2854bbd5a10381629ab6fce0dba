With admission pressures on local educational institutions, high unemployment, and worsening load shedding, South African students are increasingly opting to study abroad. According to the managing director at Sable International Study Abroad, Brent Morris, an average of 11,000 South Africans study overseas each year. While studying abroad has proven to be more expensive than studying in one’s home country, many students offset this with the prospect of obtaining an internationally recognised qualification, building a business network, then working internationally and even applying for permanent residence or citizenship, said Morris. With these prospects in mind, a report published by education platform Erudera listed the top 10 most popular study destinations for international students worldwide by numbers, which are: Of these 10 countries, the report also highlighted the four countries that host the most South African students as of the last academic year.
