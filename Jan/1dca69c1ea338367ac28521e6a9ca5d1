Luxury car brand Mercedes has announced the new specs for its sporty business saloon, the EQE, in South Africa. “2023 is an extremely important year for the Mercedes-EQ offensive in South Africa,” said Mark Raine, Co-CEO of Mercedes-Benz South Africa. “Alongside the EQA, EQB, EQC and EQS, we’re introducing the all-new, avant-garde EQE. This business saloon cements our reputation as a manufacturer of class-leading, technologically advanced luxury vehicles in the EV (electric vehicle) space,” said Raine. The EQE launched will be initially available in luxury 350+ and the more sporty AMG 43 format. According to Mercedes South Africa, the Germany-produced EQE offers a fully charged driving range of up to 645km and offers all the essential functions of the EQS in a slightly more compact format. “Compared to the luxury liner EQS, the EQE is even more streamlined, with a slightly shorter wheelbase, shorter overhangs and more recessed flanks,” Raine said. Pricing for the two versions will be at the following estimated prices: Mercedes EQE 350+ – R1,800,000
Mercedes-AMD EQE 43 4Matic – R2,200,000 “This includes a PremiumDrive Platinum 5-year/100,000 km maintenance plan and a 10-year battery warranty. Final pricing will be confirmed shortly,” said the car manufacturer. The fully electric engine allows for both models to reach a top speed of 210km/hr and are equipped with a 90.56kW battery pack. EQEs will be able to charge from 10 to 80% in 32 minutes if plugged into a consistent 170kW DC charger. The standard configured EQE 350+ is said to be powered by a single, rear-mounted electric motor, generating 215kW of power and 565Nm of torque. The AMG 4Matic will, however, put out slightly more with 350kW of power and 858Nm of torque. Mercedes told TopAuto, that more about the EQE range would be announced later in January.
