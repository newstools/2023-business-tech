South Africa will trial a new driving licence card in 2023. Transport minister Fikile Mbalula announced at the end of last year that the current driving licence cards would be phased out, with the printing machine that produces them being decommissioned in 2023. A new system will be introduced with driving licence cards linked to smart-card technology. The department previously noted that a trial on the new cards would run through to March 2024. Current cards will continue to be recognised as valid until 31 March 2029, the department said, with Mbalula also noting that the validity period for the cards would be extended from five to eight years. The current card being used in South Africa was introduced in 1998 but now fails to meet international standards regarding the technology it uses – it has also become costly to maintain the old infrastructure around the current card, Mbalula said. “The new proposed card will make the country’s driving licence compatible with the International Information Technology Personal Identification Compliant Driving Licence (ISO18013),” he said. The International Organisation for Standardization (ISO) notes that certain physical and data attributes are necessary for licences. ISO said that the new standard allows for the card to be more secure from counterfeiting and alteration, integrates more personal data and allows for more opportunities to authenticate the document, among other things.
