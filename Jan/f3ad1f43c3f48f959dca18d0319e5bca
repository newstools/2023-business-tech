South Africa’s new-vehicle market continued its gradual recovery in 2022, with twelve consecutive months of year-on-year growth. According to the National Association of Automobile Manufacturers of South Africa (Naamsa), new-vehicle sales across the passenger, light-commercial, medium-commercial, and heavy truck and bus segments totalled 528,963 units in 2022 – rising by 13.9% when compared to 2021. In the last month of 2022, 41,783 new vehicles were sold – recording an increase of 5,839 vehicles or a gain of 16,2% compared to the total of new vehicle sales of 35,944 units during the corresponding month of December 2021, said Naamsa. However, despite these positive numbers, new vehicle sales in 2022 are still 1.4% below the 536,612 units sold in 2019. Naamsa and the world’s No.1 automaker Toyota expect further near-term global supply chain disruptions to the new vehicle market in South Africa. TopAuto reported that Toyota said its outlook for 2023 remains uncertain due to a persistent shortage of semiconductors and spikes in Covid cases in China. Chip and other auto part shortages continue to plague the industry, and the rapid expansion of Covid cases throughout China will present additional difficulties, reported TopAuto. Naamsa added that just as pandemic-induced disruptions seemed to subside in early 2022, the Russian invasion of Ukraine dealt a further blow to business and consumer confidence globally and in South Africa. “The geopolitical conflict in Ukraine resulted in further supply chain disruptions and have inflated prices and the availability of strategic products and inputs.” In 2023, motorists will grapple with increasingly more expensive cars due to these national and international headwinds. Industry experts still recommend that prospective buyers shouldn’t spend more than a quarter (25%) of their monthly income on vehicle-related costs. So, if you earn R20,000 per month, your total vehicle expenses should not exceed R5,000. And this should apply to the whole vehicle expense, including: Vehicle instalments
Insurance premiums
Fuel costs Below, BusinessTech looked at what you can afford to buy on your monthly salary in South Africa, using the above assumption that people will not spend more than 25% of their gross monthly income on vehicle financing. The calculations were made using Wesbank’s repayments calculator and include the assumption of a 0% deposit for car financing. They also exclude any additional fees incurred during the loan’s inception into the calculation. Finally, the cars are financed over five years (60 months) at an annual interest rate of 10.5%. This follows a recent interest rate hike by the South African Reserve Bank in November, taking the prime rate from 9.75% to 10.5%. These calculations are purely for comparison purposes and are not meant as financial advice.
