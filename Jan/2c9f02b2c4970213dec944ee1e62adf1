Military website Global Firepower has published its military strength ranking for 2023 featuring 145 countries, with the ranking utilising more than 60 different factors to determine a given nation’s PowerIndex. The Global Firepower PowerIndex is calculated by focusing on weapon diversity rather than the total number of weapons available to any country to provide a better balance of firepower. The formula also allows smaller, more technologically-advanced nations to compete with larger, lesser-developed powers, and special modifiers – in the form of bonuses and penalties – are applied to further refine the list, which is compiled annually. One such special modifier is a nation’s access to nuclear weapons, and while they are not recognised directly, these nations receive an indirect score bonus. However, some categories directly influencing the rankings include geographical factors, logistical flexibility, natural resources and local industry – among others. In the 2023 ranking, the most powerful military forces have not changed significantly, with the United States still ranked as having the world’s strongest military power. The only changes among the top 10 are the United Kingdom (UK) moving up three places, while Japan dropped three spots. The UK now ranks as the 5th strongest military power from 8th in 2022, while Japan dropped to 8th place from 5th place in 2022. Italy also moved up one place to 10th in 2023, pushing Brazil out of the top 10 to 12th position after Turkey, which moved up two places to 11th. The US, with a $762 billion military budget, is bigger than the remaining top 10 combined ($698 billion). While the US doesn’t have the largest front line or the largest fleet of tanks, its massive military budget puts it far ahead. Top 10 military spenders (Defence Budget) US: $762 billion
