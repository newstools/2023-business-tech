Jobs portal CareerJunction has published its employment insights overview for 2022, revealing the top employing industries in South Africa. The report is based on extensive data collected from Saongroup South Africa, a platform where around 5,000 of South Africa’s top recruiters post job listings for millions of registered jobseekers. According to CareerJunction, 2022 provided many job seekers with new employment and career development opportunities. The group’s latest research analysed the movement of job seekers into new roles to determine which sectors and job roles have seen the most movement over 2022. CareerJunction said that the Admin, Office & Support sectors and the Sales, Finance, Transportation and Education sectors were full of opportunities for employees to jump ship from one profession to another. Although the diversity of opportunities is encouraging to see, it is important to bear in mind that different industries require a collection of different skills and expertise, said CareerJunction. Out of the top five sectors, the most predominant new job roles over the year were in Admin, Office & Support, including field workers, general workers, cashiers, receptionists and administrators. Within the top five sectors, according to the report, the most predominant new job roles in 2022 were split among the following: Admin, Office & Support: Field workers, general workers, cashiers, receptionists and administrators;
Sales: Within this industry, agents and sales consultants got the newest positions;
Finance: Accountants landed the newest roles in this sector;
Transportation: Drivers were in high demand, said Career Junction;
Education: Tutors gained a significant amount of new opportunities. “Interestingly, roles like field worker, general worker, cashier, and tutor attracted many job seekers without previous work experience.
