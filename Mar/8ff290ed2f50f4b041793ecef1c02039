South Africa has been hit with the perfect storm of bad news in the past week, with the ongoing energy crisis, poor GDP data, declining business confidence and a current account deficit in negative territory all emerging against the backdrop of material risk-off sentiment in global financial markets. It is no surprise then that the rand has taken a beating in the same period, weakening to R18.74 against the dollar at one point, before recovering at the start of the week to around R18.20. According to Investec chief economist Annabel Bishop, the rand is heavily undervalued due to high-risk aversion in global financial markets and particularly negative investor sentiment against South Africa on its worsening growth outlook as its productive capacity deteriorates. “Against the euro and pound, the domestic currency is also heavily undervalued and running poorly against the crosses, near the bottom of the Bloomberg EM currency ranker on an annual comparison,” she said. The downward pressure on the rand stemmed from the disappointing Q4 GDP numbers (a 1.3% contraction vs market expectations of -0.4%), which provided evidence of the devastating impact of relentless load-shedding on the economy, and the unexpected downgrade of South Africa’s credit ratings outlook by S&P Global. S&P Global made a voluntary outlook review, changing South Africa’s outlook to stable, from positive before. This brings S&P in line with other major rating firms, Moody’s and Fitch, on South Africa’s economic prospects. “South Africa’s worsening electricity crisis came at a poor time against the backdrop of material risk-off sentiment in global financial markets, while load shedding also adds to the cost environment, with SA’s inflation still high, weakening the rand,” Bishop said. “All the rating agencies have evinced concern over SA’s weakening economic growth outlook, with Moody’s recently having said that the country’s longest-ever stretch of power cuts is credit negative.” Bishop said that rating agencies are taking a wait and see approach to South Africa’s electricity crisis, with any slow repair to the electricity crisis increasing the downgrade risk. Economists at the Bureau for Economic Research (BER) said that a downgrade is unlikely at this stage, but even without the imminent threat, the local economy is in trouble. Even if South Africa managed to avoid a technical recession, the country’s growth prospects are extremely limited and are unlikely to exceed 0.5% for 2023, the BER said. Investec said that the increased risk of a downgrade and lower growth prospects have impacted its economic scenarios for South Africa. A notable change across all scenarios is that South Africa has been greylisted by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), which means the scenarios are now contingent on how long the country remains on the list.
