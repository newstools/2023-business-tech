As AI technology like ChatGPT evolves, so do the strategies and tactics used by cybercriminals. Steve Flynn, Sales and Marketing Director at ESET Southern Africa, says ongoing awareness is crucial in understanding how to manage potential cybersecurity challenges posed by these developing tools. As artificial intelligence (AI) technology becomes a new reality for individuals and businesses, its potential impact on cybersecurity cannot be ignored.

ChatGPT raises concerns due to its natural language processing capabilities, which could be used to create highly personalised and sophisticated cyberattacks. However, as with any other tool, the use (or misuse) depends on the hand that wields it. Organisations like OpenAI are visibly committed to ensuring their technology is used ethically and responsibly and have implemented safeguards to prevent misuse. Businesses can do the same. To protect their digital assets and people from harm, it is essential to implement strong cybersecurity measures, and to develop ethical frameworks and regulations to ensure that AI is used for positive purposes and not for malicious activities. By leveraging the power of AI technology, businesses and individuals can drive innovation, improve productivity and business outcomes with powerful new solutions. However, it is important to balance the potential benefits of AI technology with the potential risks and ensure that AI is used ethically and responsibly. By taking a proactive approach to AI governance, we can help minimise the potential risks associated with AI technology and maximise the benefits for business and humanity. As AI technology evolves, so too must our cybersecurity strategies.
