Openview owner eMedia has announced that it will launch a new pay-TV service, Ultraview, on 6 March 2023. Ultraview will enable viewers to watch additional bouquets of content for a monthly subscription alongside the free content available on Openview on the same decoder. Openview currently only offers a free-to-view service to viewers as long as they have a decoder and dish. The Ultraview offering will now add bouquets of different content on a subscription basis to viewed alongside these services. eMedia said the service will allow customers to view niche content in one convenient place via standalone packages. This includes two channels focused on LGBTQI+ matters – OUTtv and FUSE – via the Pride bouquet, which will be available for R74.99 per month. First-time users will be able to access the Pride bouquet’s content via a 3-day trial period, after which a monthly fee will be applied. “Subscribers to Ultraview have the option of cancelling the subscription at any time,” eMedia said. “Ultraview will be adding more bouquets to the service very soon. Viewers can look forward to the Spice bouquet, which will also feature two channels of delightful content.” Read: Multichoice is launching a new mega streaming service with Comcast
