According to the National Association of Automobile Manufacturers of South Africa (Naamsa), South African consumers purchased 45,352 new vehicles in February 2023, representing a slight year-on-year increase of 2.5% compared to the same period last year. As of February 2023, Toyota remains the most popular brand in South Africa, selling 11,560 vehicles. This is partly due to the popularity of its flagship bakkie – the Toyota Hilux – which sold a whopping 3,335 units. Volkswagen (VW) is the second most popular brand, with 5,288 units sold, while Suzuki is third, with a total of 4,309 units sold. Toyota comprised 25.5% of all vehicles sold in February. This is more than the combined sales of VW (11.7%) and Suzuki (9.5%), which comprised 21.2% of all vehicles sold. Of the total reported industry sales of 45,352 vehicles, 83.6% were represented by dealer sales, 9% to the vehicle rental industry, 5.1% to the government, and 2.3% to corporate industry fleets. The top 10 brands that sold the most cars locally in February 2023 were: 2023 expectations Despite the positive numbers in domestic sales, Naamsa noted that exports declined by a sizeable 11.5%, which is concerning considering the automotive industry contributes 4.3% to South Africa’s GDP. “The destructive higher stages of load shedding have amplified the negative impact on South Africa’s vehicle production and component manufacturing, which has put pressure on the country’s export sector,” the association said. Naamsa added that the current inflationary environment means consumer spending and household discretionary income continues to shrink with increases in fuel costs, electricity costs and many other essential costs that directly impact on vehicle sales decisions of our motorists. It also noted its disappointment in the National Treasury’s stance not to announce any support programme for the manufacturing of NEVs and NEV components in the country, dampening spirits within the sector. Despite the unpredictability in the new vehicle market, Naamsa noted that sales should still see an uptick in 2023. “While momentum for the new vehicle market has been slow, it is forecasted that both domestic sales will grow by 6.3% and export sales will grow by 8.3% in 2023,” it said. Best-selling models Unsurprisingly, the Toyota Hilux came out on top as the best-selling car in February 2023. Toyota boasted four models in the top ten most popular cars – which included the Hilux (1st), Toyota Corolla Cross (4th), Toyota Hi-Ace (7th), and the Toyota Starlet (8th). The second and third most popular brands, VW and Suzuki, also featured models in the top ten – the VW Polo Vivo (5th) and the Suzuki Swift (6th). A notable move in the ranking experienced by Ford, with its bakkie – the Ford Ranger – moving up four places from sixth in January to the second best-selling car in February 2023. This positive move is likely due to the popularity of its new next-gen Ranger, which received a facelift and attractive interior interactions.
