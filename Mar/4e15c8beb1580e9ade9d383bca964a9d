Cape Town outperforms Johannesburg and Sandton when it comes to the number of mega luxury home sales, says Samuel Seeff, the chairman of Seeff Property Group. Official deeds office transactions over the last few years highlight this fact, said Seeff. “We continue seeing the strengthening of the general trend of affluent high net worth buyers (HNWIs) who spend in excess of USD 1 million on property in the Cape compared to less than half of that on average in the wealthy suburbs of Sandton and Johannesburg.” When comparing the number of transactions above R5 million, the data shows that almost 70% were concluded in the Cape Town metro (2,354 transactions) compared to less than half (1,046 transactions) across Sandton and Johannesburg, said the chairman. Transactions above R10 million show that 77% were concluded in Cape Town (546 transactions) compared to just 160 in Johannesburg/Sandton. Transactions above R20 million (USD 1 million approx.) show that a notable 84% of all sales were concluded in the Cape, mostly across the Atlantic Seaboard, City Bowl and Southern Suburbs, but also in Stellenbosch and Hermanus, he added. According to Seeff, the top ten suburbs where affluent buyers invested in homes priced over R20 million include: BusinessTech looked at what some of the houses look like: Constantia 8 Bedroom House for Sale in Constantia – R32,500,000      8 Bedroom House for Sale in Constantia – R59,000,000       Camps Bay 5 Bedroom House for Sale in Camps Bay – R32,000,000       6 Bedroom House for Sale in Camps Bay – R49,995,000      Fresnaye 3 Bedroom Apartment / Flat for Sale in Fresnayen Camps Bay – R23,495,000     3 Bedroom Apartment / Flat for Sale in Fresnay – R35,000,000      Waterfront 3 Bedroom Apartment/ Flat for Sale in Waterfront – R49,995,000      Bedroom Apartment/ Flat for Sale in Waterfront  – R29,500,000     Llandudno 5 Bedroom House for sale in Llandudno – R35,900,000     Stellenbosch Farm for Sale in Stellenbosch Farms – R31,950,000      Bantry Bay 5 Bedroom House for Sale in Bantry Bay – R55,000,000     Clifton 3 Bedroom Apartment/ Flat for sale in Clifton – R119,000,000     Bishopscourt 5 Bedroom House for Sale in Bishopscourt – R29,500,000      Sandhurst 5 Bedroom House for Sale in Sandhurst – R35,000,000      Read: Take a look at the new 30,000 square metre ‘mega-beach’ that just launched in Joburg
