Balwin Properties has launched its R10 billion Munyaka development in Waterfall City, which is home to one of the biggest crystal-clear lagoons in the southern hemisphere. The development has already completed its first phase, with 1,000 apartments completed and occupied, while the arched lifestyle centre – which features gym facilities, restaurants and more – is also open for businesses. On completion in 2023, the development will boast 5,020 fibre-ready apartments featuring a Scandinavian-style kitchen, free eco-friendly appliances, a balcony or patio for outdoor entertaining, plus pre-paid water and electricity meters. Munyaka will also offer residents other amenities such as an on-site concierge, meeting rooms, a swimming pool, laundromats, a cinema, a wellness spa and water activities such as paddle boarding and canoeing. The Munyaka development plan is expansive. The main highlight of the development is the 3-hectare (30,000 square metres) clear-water lagoon at the centre of the project, which Balwin describes as bringing “Hollywood-style beach living to Johannesburg”. This makes the lagoon double the size of the clear-water lagoon the developer built at The Blyde in Pretoria.      Pricing for apartments around the lagoon starts at R3 million and go up to R70 million. 1 Bed, 1 Bath from R2,999,900 Lagoon & beach facing

This is ostensibly to avoid the same conflict and issues surrounding short-term letters that hit The Blyde. The development of Munyaka resulted in several infrastructure upgrades in the node, including the improvement of Mia Road by Balwin at a cost of over R100 million. Additional infrastructure upgrades are planned for the long term include the establishment of a Gautrain station within walking distance from Munyaka, the extension of the K60 from Van Der Bijl Avenue to Allandale Road, as well as the establishment of a world-class sporting facility and retail convenience centre of approximately 20,000 square metres.
