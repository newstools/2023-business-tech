Eskom has updated its load shedding schedules for Sunday. The group said that stage 4 load shedding will be implemented from 16h00 on Saturday to 05h00 on Sunday; thereafter, stage 2 load shedding will kick in. Stage 3 load shedding will be implemented overnight into the new week. A further update for the week ahead will be provided in due course. Saturday, 4 March Stage 3: until 16h00
Stage 4: 16h00 to 00h00 Sunday, 5 March Stage 4: 00h00 to 05h00
Stage 2: 05h00 to 16h00
Stage 3: 16h00 to 00h00 Monday, 6 March Stage 3: 00h00 to 05h00
Stage TBD: 05h00 onwards South Africa has suffered through 125 consecutive days of load shedding since late October 2022. Analysis of load shedding trends in the country shows that despite all promises to the contrary, rolling blackouts are getting increasingly worse and unless there some serious interventions to change course, the country will likely hit stage 7 and 8 load shedding by August 2023. The national government has assured South Africans that plans are in place to add capacity to the grid, but none of these plans are short-term or offer quick relief. Eskom, meanwhile, is in the process of reviewing its load shedding schedules to make room for higher stages, should the need arise. Markets, businesses and South Africans at large are waiting for president Cyril Ramaphosa to appoint his new ‘minister of electricity’, who will have the unenviable task of being solely responsible for ending the load shedding crisis.
