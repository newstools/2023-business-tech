During the same period, a generating unit each at Kriel, Medupi and Tutuka power stations were taken offline for repairs, Eskom said. The company added that the return to service of a generating unit each at Duvha, Medupi, Tutuka and two units at Hendrina power stations has however been delayed.

Although the energy crisis has taken the front seat of South Africa’s politics and multiple initiatives, have been implemented. Analysts and researchers at the large point to no short-term reprieve from rolling blackouts. Recent data from the Bureau of Economic Research (BER) showed that relative to 2022, 2023 has been the worst load shedding on record. The research firm expressed worry over the fact that when looking into 2022, South Africa’s summer months had the worst levels of load shedding despite being periods of low demand. Winter months – which start from around June – typically see the highest demand, said the BER. This puts Eskom and the government on a tight deadline to address the crisis before the winter months kick in. The schedule is as follows: Sunday, 12 March Stage 4: 16h00 to 00h00 Monday, 13 March Stage 4: 00h00 to 16h00
Stage 5: 16h00 to 00h00 Tuesday, 14 March Stage 5: 00h00 to 05h00
Stage 4: 05h00 to 16h00
Stage 5: 16h00 to 05h00 Wednesday, 15 March Stage 5: 00h00 to 05h00
Stage 4: 05h00 to 16h00
Stage 5: 16h00 to 05h00 According to Eskom, this pattern will continue until further notice. Schedules For people living in the major metros, load shedding schedules are available here: City of Johannesburg
