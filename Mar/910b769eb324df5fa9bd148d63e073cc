Despite major economic headwinds facing most South Africans, several cars are on the market for millions of rand. South Africa’s domestic vehicle sales have shown a strong start to the year, with consumers purchasing 45,352 new vehicles in February 2023 – a 2.5% increase compared to the same period in 2022. Bakkies swept the podium for the best-selling cars, with the Toyota Hilux (3,335), Ford Ranger (1,806) and Isuzu D-Max (1,747) being the most sold cars in South Africa during February. Despite inflationary pressures and load shedding, the National Association of Automobile Manufacturers of South Africa (Naamsa) said that domestic vehicle sales would continue to grow. “While momentum for the new vehicle market has been slow, it is forecasted that both domestic sales will grow by 6.3% and export sales will grow by 8.3% in 2023,” Naamsa said. However, most of the best-selling cars in South Africa are under the price of R500,000, with only the seventh most-sold car in February, the Toyota Hi-Ace (R512,700), having a starting price of over half a million. The following list of cars is for the uber-wealthy in South Africa. For instance, the Lamborghini Huracan STO will set a South African motorist back over R8.2 million. Despite Naamsa expecting sales to increase, South Africans are not likely to purchase cars worth millions of rands, even if the country was not facing a recession. Luxury car dealerships often do not include prices for their higher-end models, as wealthy consumers will change certain features of the car. As a result, cars with a price on application (POA) were excluded from this list. Eight cars costing over R4 million are listed below (the most expensive model was chosen for each car featured): (Note: The list only includes cars with a base price, despite there being cars in South Africa that could cost more) 1.
