Crossover SUVs are very popular in South Africa, offering the benefits of a standard SUV with a cheaper price tag. One of the main factors driving the popularity of SUVs is their ability to navigate South Africa’s often challenging road conditions. Many parts of the country have poorly maintained roads, and SUVs, with their high ground clearance and sturdy construction, are better suited to handling these conditions than the average sedan or hatchback. Another reason for the popularity of SUVs is their versatility. They can be used for both family transport to and from school as well as off-road adventures. This flexibility appeals to many South Africans who value vehicles that can meet multiple needs. However, standard SUVs have become quite expensive, with the cheapest being the Mahindra Scorpio – starting at almost R400,000. This is unaffordable for most South Africans, especially considering the cost of the living crisis faced by many as a result of high fuel costs, load shedding, hyperinflation and interest rate hikes. Considering this, many South African motorists have turned to crossovers, which now offer dozens of models at various price ranges to suit almost any need a prospective buyer may have. This is evident month-on-month, as crossovers such as the Toyota Corolla Cross, Chery Tiggo 4 Pro, Toyota Urban Cruiser and the VW T-Cross continue to feature on Naamsa’s monthly top 15 best sellers list. Crossovers are lighter than the standard SUV, built on a regular car frame, while a traditional SUV is typically built on a truck (bakkie) frame. This gives the crossover the benefits of having higher clearance and more room than a hatchback while maintaining a low fuel consumption compared to a normal SUV. Due to the popularity of crossovers in South Africa, several brands have now included a crossover model in their range – offering these versatile cars as a hybrid or petrol variant, with 4×4 capabilities in some cases, along with all the bells and whistles one would expect from a modern-day vehicle. Overall, SUV popularity in South Africa will likely continue for the foreseeable future. As the country’s infrastructure continues to develop, more people will be able to afford and enjoy these versatile and practical vehicles.
