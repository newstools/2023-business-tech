PayShap, a new real-time payment service, launched this week (13 March) in partnership with four South African banks – and some offer better fee incentives than others. BankservAfrica and the Payments Association of South Africa (Pasa) launched the new real-time payments service earlier this week with Absa, FNB, Nedbank, and Standard Bank. Banks supporting the PayShap protocol let customers link their cellphone numbers to their bank accounts, allowing customers to use these “ShapIDs” instead of bank account numbers to receive payments. Banks refer to this as a “proxy payment”, where your ShapID acts as a stand-in or proxy for your bank account number. Currently, PayShap allows customers to transfer funds of up to R3,000 per transaction. However, when comparing these four banks’ PayShap transfer fees, if you bank with Absa and Standard Bank, non-real-time EFT is far more cost-effective than PayShap. Absa currently charges R45 for PayShap transactions over R1,000, while a non-real-time EFT costs only R1. Comparatively, Standard Bank charges R7.50 for all PayShap transactions while charging R1.20 for a non-real-time EFT – effectively disincentivising using PayShap for large-value transfers. FNB and Nedbank, on the other hand, have launched cheaper PayShap tariffs. Nedbank charges a flat R1 fee for all ShapID-to-ShapID transactions, offering a substantially cheaper alternative to regular immediate interbank payments and its non-real-time EFT fee of R2.20. However, PayShap transactions to regular bank account numbers are billed at R7.50 each, like Standard Bank. Nedbank is also running a promotion where all PayShap transactions are free until 30 April 2023. FNB is offering free PayShap transactions for amounts below R100, while payments over R100 are billed at a flat rate of R6 each – once again making them cheaper than regular immediate payments but more expensive than EFT, which currently has no charge. This means that unless you desperately need payments to clear immediately, banks offer almost no incentive to use PayShap. The table below compares the PayShap and EFT fees offered at the four banks.
